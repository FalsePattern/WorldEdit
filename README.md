WorldEdit is an easy-to-use in-game world editor for Minecraft, supporting both
single player and multiplayer, that lets you:

* Change thousands of blocks in an area at once by selecting regions.
* Use over 100 functions to modify the world or remove problems.
* Remove large chunks of land as you wish.
* Sculpt the world and build mountains with brushes.
* Fix annoyances such as broken water, missing snow, raging fires, and more.

WorldEdit is open source and is available under the GNU Lesser General Public
License v3.

## Fork info

This is a fork of WorldEdit 6.1.1 for 1.7.10, with the goal of centralizing any improvements and changes into a single location,
removing the need for bespoke ASM and mixins from various mods that deeply change world formats, as well as integrating fixes that have been discovered over the years.
